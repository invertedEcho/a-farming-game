at first, only do a really small game to not do the classic mistake of overscoping

scope:
- player movement with camera mouse
- a small island
- few dirtpatches where you can put crops to
- they grow over time
- when they are done growing, a npc arrives and wants to buy the plant
- you have to sell it to him and you get coins
- this is it for now
